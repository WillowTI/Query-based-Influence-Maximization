## Suggested Environment

Cygwin + CLion



## Environmental Variable

something like

-dataset nethept/ -k 50 -model IC -epsilon 0.1



## What has been done

+ raw Influence Maximization algorithm using RRSet

   + Input: a directed Graph G

   + Output: a number I denoting the Max Influence of G, the induced subgraph H which has Max Influence

+ O(m) k-core algorithm in undirected graph




## What is needed

+ FP-Tree data structure to optimize sampling procedure

+ ij-core in directed graph
