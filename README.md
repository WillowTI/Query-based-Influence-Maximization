## Suggested Environment

Cygwin + CLion



## Environmental Variable

something like

-dataset nethept/ -k 50 -model IC -epsilon 0.1



## Current State

raw Influence Maximization algorithm using RRSet

Input: a directed Graph $$G$$

Output: a number $$I$$ denoting the Max Influence of $$G$$, the induced subgraph $$G_s$$ which has Max Influence



## Future Work

+ $$O(m)$$ k-core algorithm under undirected graph (unnecessary but help understand the ij-core algorithm under directed graph)

+ FP-Tree data structure to optimize sampling procedure
